# Deliverable 7
In this deliverable you will be testing out and showing your ability to use the Microphone as well as the Ultrasonic sensor. These components will allow you to recognize and move toward the frequencies at the end of this project.


## Sound Detect(P)
For this part of the deliverable your task is to detect a single sound using your Microphone. One easy way to show that your microphone is detecting sound is to use LEDs in combination with your GPIOs on your raspberry pi. See how sensitive you microphone is, how loud of a speaker you may need to use (Phone/Laptop/Speaker/etc.), and whether your microphone responds to all 3 sounds required for the final check point(refer to README). This sound detection will be very important as you get ready for your next big checkpoint after spring break; Single Sound Detect.

## Ultrasonic Detect(P)
This part will be similar to the one before, your task is to test your ultrasonic sensor and be able to detect when an object is within 4 inches of your car, you will need this capability for the final checkpoint.(Refer to the Project Description Document for more information).

## Power Supply(P)
# Summary

In summary, for this week you need to:

1. **P**: Sound Detection Demonstrated by LEDs
2. **P**: Ultrasonic Detection Demonstrated by LEDs
3. **P**: Start Power Supply Design
4. Update your User Manual and Technical Documentation with your findings.
