# Deliverable 12
For Deliverable 12, you will be taking on your third and final checkpoint. Differentiating Sounds. This check point is the **"Minimum Set to be considered for a A-"** remember that passing this checkpoint does not guarantee you a B but allows you to be eligible for one. 

## Differentiating Sounds(D)
This deliverable will be performed in class, Your team is responsible for the following

Your car must be able to differentiate three different freqencies which are playing simultaneously. Your car must identify and move to each frequency source in the correct order and without hitting the source. The frequencies of interest are:

* A) 500 Hz sine wave
* B) 2kHz sine wave
* C) 8kHz sine wave

The three sound sources will be positioned within 3-5 feet of the **starting** position of the car (placed by grader). the car will identify and find the sound sources in order (A,B,C). The front of the car must be within 4 inches of the sound source and stop. After stopping, the car will find the next sound source in sequence.

**Testing Tips to Recall:** As per Dr. Herring's email, You do not have to disconnect the usonic sensor.  However, we still need a way to determine that you are accurately using the audio filter.  So, count on having more than one sound active simultaneously.  We may also put out an item that does not make any sound to allow us to verify both the usonic and the audio filter function.


**Turn In on ELC:**  Video proof of deliverable completion,(dont forget to upload code to github)
