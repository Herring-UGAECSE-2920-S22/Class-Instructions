# Deliverable 2

For this week, completing a syllabus quiz, you'll be creating a team attendance sheet, documenting the state of existing hardware you have recieved and going through the preliminary setup for the Raspberry Pi hardware. 

Right now would also be a good time to read through the rules for the project outlined [in the README](../README.md) for this repository.
 

## Documenting Existing Behavior (P)

For this section of the deliverable, you'll be following the included instructions or using your own design to assemble and use your car. While doing that please ensure your kit has all the neccessary parts and that those parts work. This will be very important for a smooth return process at the end of the semester. To help with this see [this guide](./setup/car_parts.md) for the parts and how they should be working.

## Assemble Hardware (P)

For this section you will need to assemble your car. Before Assembling see the included guide for guidelines while building. You may use the instructions included in the kit or assemble it your own way. 

## Raspberry Pi Setup (P)

Finally, you'll need to go through the Raspberry Pi setup documentation found [here](setup/pi_setup.md). It will guide you through setting up the Pi and getting all of the Python dependencies and environment set up. It will also link to helpful documentation for how to work on the Raspberry Pi, remotely or otherwise.

## Practice Committing Changes(P)

After your Raspberry Pi is fully setup along with your github account. You can now use git to save changes on the pi to github or save changes on github to the pi. This is very useful when coding in groups. 


# Summary

In summary, for this week you need to:

1. Make sure you have acquired all of the hardware for your team.

2. Assemble the Audio Car Kit, and get familar with your hardware.

3. Go though the Raspberry Pi setup, and acquaint yourself with working on the Pi/Github/etc.

4. Practice Commiting Changes, make sure they are showing up on your repository 

5. Update your User Manual and Technical Documentation with your findings.
