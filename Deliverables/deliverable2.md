# Deliverable 2

For this week, completing a syllabus quiz, you'll be creating a team attendance sheet, documenting the behavior of the existing XY-Plotter provided and going through the preliminary setup for the Raspberry Pi hardware. Finally, You'll need to return your unused hardware to Dr.Herring, Dr.Trudgen, or the TAs by class on Friday.

Right now would also be a good time to read through the rules for the project outlined [in the README](../README.md) for this repository.

## Team Attendance Sheet (P)

Each class period, circumstances withstanding, at least two members of your team should be in attendance to ask questions, participate in class discussion, do activities, etc. However, due to the limited capacity of our classroom (~half of the class size at 40 people) you all will need to get with your group mates and create a schedule such that ***all*** of you can come to class during the semester. 

**P**: Since most teams will have 5 or 6 people, you will have to create some form of attendance rotation. Create this schedule and include it in your submission for this deliverable.  Note, at least 2 members must be present for each class (3 team members for 6 person teams) and all other team members are on ZOOM.  The rotation cannot change.  Each student is either attending on Monday or Friday.  We will allow a day change after midterm.  Note, all teams can send 3 member each day if they want.  On days with presentations, all team members must be present.  

## Documenting Existing Behavior (P)

For this section of the deliverable, you'll be following INSERT GUIDE HERE to assemble and use your car.


## Raspberry Pi Setup (P)

Finally, you'll need to go through the Raspberry Pi setup documentation found [here](setup/pi_setup.md). It will guide you through setting up the Pi and getting all of the Python dependencies and environment set up. It will also link to helpful documentation for how to work on the Raspberry Pi, remotely or otherwise.
