# Deliverable 6
For deliverable 6, you will begin moving forward from your first check point and diving into your filter design. This filter design will be what distinguishes your frequencies and allows you to detect particular sounds as you prepare for the next checkpoint.

## Preliminary Filter Design (P)
For this Deliverable your team will be required to dive into your filter design for your Audio car. You must create a paper design of your filter idea and follow that up with a computer simulared design that includes a Bode Plot. You will only be required to do this for the 2kHz frequency. (This will also be the frequency that we will check for in deliverable 9) This will be your first step to designing your filter please document this process and the logic behind your design.

**TURN IN-On ELC**: Paper Design of your filter as well as a computer simulated design for this filter that includes a Bode Plot.

## Recheck Deliverable 5
If you have not passed the Chekpoint from last week you will have an oppurtunity this week to get it checked off. This will not be for a regrade of that deliverable but rather a confirmaton that you have completed the first checkpoint and can feel more comfortable moving forward. Please bring your car to class if you wish you get the checkpoint rechecked.

**TURN IN-On ELC**: If you have not passed this checkpoint you can upload a short video showing Deliverable 5a & 5b Please follow the same rubric that you will follow when presenting in class. Feel free to narrate these so that we can better understand the functions of your design.


# Summary

In summary, for this week you need to:

1. **P**: Complete and turn in your preliminary filter design which include the paper design as well as the computer simulated design and Bode plot 

2. **P**: If applicable show code revisions and come to class prepared for a recheck of physical drawings.

3. Update your User Manual and Technical Documentation with your findings.
