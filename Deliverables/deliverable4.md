# Deliverable 4
For deliverable 4, you will be programming your audio car's motors to be used at the same rate of speed using a transfer function. In addition you will also be illustration and describing your power diagram and GPIOS.

## Transfer Function (P)
Once you have both of your motors moving, you may have noticed that they do not move at the same rate of speed. In this deliverabel you will fix this. You will need to use your optical encoders along with the to calculate a transfer function that will get both of your DC motors moving at the same RPM. You can test this by running your car in a straight line and making sure it does not veer to the left or to the right. 

## Power Diagram (P)


# Summary

In summary, for this week you need to:

1. Using the optical encoders provided, calculate and solidify a transfer function that successfully makes both of your DC motors move at the same rate of speed

2. Draw and describe your power diagram and program GPIOs
