These instructions are for the BK Precision 2544C-MSO Oscilloscopes. These have a nice built in FFT / spectrum analyzer. Other scopes can also be used.

Steps:

1. Press the “Wave Gen” button on the top right of the menu. Configure the Wave Type as “Noise”. 
2. Plug a BNC cable into the rear “WAVEGEN” connector on the scope. This would be the test signal you run through the circuit.
3. Plug a BNC cable into CH1 on the scope. This would be connected to the output of your circuit.
4. Press the “Math” button and select “FFT”. 
5. Press “Source” and select whichever channel you used.
6. Adjust the settings to fit your signal and desired plot.
