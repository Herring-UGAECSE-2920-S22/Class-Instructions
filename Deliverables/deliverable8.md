# Deliverable 8
In this deliverable your teams will solidify your filter design that you began the preliminary work for in Deliverable 6 and you will need to create a 2-bit ADC. This design will lay the foundation for Deliverable 9(Checkpoint 2) which is NEXT WEEK! Though there are only two things to turn in this week it is a stepping stone to what is next, look at the Minimum requirement for a 'B' on ELC and prepare for next week accordingly. 


## Hardware Design for Filtering and ADC (P)

**Filter:**
Finalize and test your schematic for your filter. As a reminder, the objective of this filter is to receive sound frequencies 500Hz, 2kHZ, and 8kHz (We will test for 2kHz in deliverable 9) and be able to determine where that sound is so that you can move to it. Explain your filter. How does it work? How did you size component values for the desired frequency? Lastly, verify your hardware filter design; show a photo of the experimental (not simulated) Bode Plot and frequency response of the filter using the spectrum analyzer.

**Sound Steering Input:**
In order to drive to the sound, you must have a way to give direction to your PI.  The PI takes digital inputs so you will need to transform your audio filter outputs (analog) into digital which requires an analog to digital converter (ADC) of some type.  Dr Trudgen hinted that 2-bits might be sufficient.  You may use more, but over designing can make things more complicated and harder to get working. 

Your ADC will allow you to determine the strength of the sound your car is receiving and will be used to navigate to the sound source in grade checkpoint deliverable 9. Prove the schematic of your ADC works to help you differentiate the location of the sound. Explain how the ADC you made works and how it interfaces with the audio filter and with the Raspberry Pi, in an in-depth written description. 

**TURN-IN on ELC:** A document containing 1) your filter and ADC finalized schematic, 2) A photo of your physical hardware, 3) A written description of your filter design, including math to back up claims, 4) Photos of your physical filter response (Spectrum analyzer and Bode Plot, and 5) A written description of your ADC.  Make sure to include at least pseudo code for the PI response to the ADC input.


# Summary
