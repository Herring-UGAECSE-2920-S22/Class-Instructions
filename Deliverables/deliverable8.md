# Deliverable 8
In this deliverable your teams will solidify your filter design that you began the preliminary work for in Deliverable 6. This design will lay the foundation for Deliverable 9(Checkpoint 2). Though there is only one thing to turn in this week it is a stepping stone to what is next. In addition to that you will need to create a 2-bit ADC.


## Hardware Filter Design(P)
Reminder: The objective of this filter is to recieve sound frequencies 500Hz,2kHZ,and 8kHz **(We will test for 2kHz in deliverable 9)** and be able to determine where that sound is so that you can move to it. Think back to deliverable 6 and your Preliminary Filter Design. 

**TURN-IN on ELC:** Your filter design via Multisim, in hardware using a function generator or other frequency source and spectrum analyzer output, or with Matlab. Include a EXPERIMENTAL bode plot in your documentation as well.

## 2-bit ADC
This ADC will allow you to determine the strength of the sound your car is recieving.**More to come**


# Summary

In summary, for this week you need to:

1. **P:** Filter Design(Experimental Bode Plot)
2. Update your User Manual and Technical Documentation with your findings.
