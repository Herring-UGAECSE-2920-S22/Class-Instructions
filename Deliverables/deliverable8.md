# Deliverable 8
In this deliverable your teams will solidify your filter design that you began the preliminary work for in Deliverable 6 and you will need to create a 2-bit ADC. This design will lay the foundation for Deliverable 9(Checkpoint 2) which is NEXT WEEK! Though there is only two things to turn in this week it is a stepping stone to what is next, look at the Minimum requirement for a 'B' on ELC and prepare for next week accordingly. 


## Hardware Filter Design(P)
Reminder: The objective of this filter is to recieve sound frequencies 500Hz,2kHZ,and 8kHz **(We will test for 2kHz in deliverable 9)** and be able to determine where that sound is so that you can move to it. Think back to deliverable 6 and your Preliminary Filter Design. 

**TURN-IN on ELC:** Your filter design in hardware using a function generator or other frequency source and spectrum analyzer output. Include a EXPERIMENTAL bode plot in your documentation as well.

## 2-bit ADC(P)
This ADC will allow you to determine the strength of the sound your car is recieving.**More to come**


# Summary

In summary, for this week you need to:

1. **P:** Filter Design(Experimental Bode Plot)
2. **P:** 2-bit ADC
3. Update your User Manual and Technical Documentation with your findings.
