# Deliverable 11
For Deliverable 11, you will be taking your power supply from the previous deliverables and translating it to a PCB. In addition to that you will be creating a Bode Plot using your Multifilter Design in prepration for **Deliverable 12** This deliverable may not seem like alot but be reminded your Final Checkpoint is right around the corner!

## PCB Design(D)
For this deliverable, your team will be required to provide a PCB design based on your circuit using EAGLE, Altium, or any PCB software you prefer. 


**TURN IN-On ELC**: PCB File(board file and schematic file), screenshots of those things also included in your ElC documentation.


## Bode Plots for Multifilter Design(P)
For this deliverable, your team will be required to create a Bode Plot for your Multifilter circuit using the Spectrum Analyzer. Make sure you are doing this using your physical hardware in order to prep for deliverable 12. This is to make sure your filter is working as expected.

**Turn IN-On ELC**: Documentation with photos of Bode Plot, along with documentation of what is going on in your Bode Plot. There should be 3 Bode Plots

# Summary

In summary, for this week you need to:

1. **D**: Translate Power Supply to PCB
2. **P**: Bode Plots for multifilter design
3. Update your User Manual and Technical Documentation with your findings.
